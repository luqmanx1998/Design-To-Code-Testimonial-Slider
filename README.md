# Coding Bootcamp Testimonial Slider

![DESIGN-IMG](design/desktop-design-slide-1.jpg)

## Overview

A clean, functional testimonial slider created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This slider is fully responsive and really tested my HTML/CSS skills in unexpected ways.

## Challenges Faced

- **HTML/CSS Layouts**  
  Surprisingly, the hardest part of this challenge wasnâ€™t the JavaScriptâ€”it was getting the HTML/CSS layout just right! Working with `overflow: hidden` in the parent container of the slides added complexity to positioning and dimensions. I had to restructure my HTML and CSS multiple times to align with the design while keeping the slider functional.  
  Initially, I struggled with positioning and image dimensions until I realized Iâ€™d forgotten to add a fixed height to the slider parent container. Without this, elements disappeared with `overflow: hidden` applied. Lesson learned! ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™ll never miss that step again.

## Tools & Techniques

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **JavaScript**: DOM Manipulation & Slider Functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Leveraging `display`, `position`, and other CSS properties to create a fluid layout beyond simple media queries.
- **Problem-Solving**: Using past project experience to tackle unexpected layout issues.
